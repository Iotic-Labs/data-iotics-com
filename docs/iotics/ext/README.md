# IOTICS Information model

IOTICS technology enables the formation of ecosystems that facilitates data and information exchange in a secure, trusted and interoperable way.
This enables the creation of services and processes that go across the enterprise boundaries whilst, at the same time, providing sovereignty to the data owners, over their content.

The Information Model defines a domain-agnostic lingua franca of the International Data Spaces. It constitutes a central agreement shared by its participants and components, facilitating compatibility and interoperability. The Information Model primarily aims at the description, publication and discovery of data products and data processing software within the International Data Spaces. A structured, semantic annotation ensures the provision of the most relevant assets, appropriate for a client's task. Once identified, the Information Model enables automated consumption of those offerings via service interface and protocol binding definitions. Next to those core assets, the Information Model further describes essential properties of International Data Spaces entities, its participants, infrastructure components and processes.



## What it is

This is an ontology defining the vocabulary of terms used in IOTICS that define what IOTICS is.

The full information model extends the basic ontology used by IOTICS in its product. Having a machine readable format for these concepts provides a few advantages:

1. It is possible to express semantically and unambigously the relationship between the entities defining IOTICS.
1. The content can be validated
1. The content can be parsed and rendered in a variety of formats suitable for consumption by many parties
1. Embed it in portal and have portal as a basic management/reporting tool for IOTICSpaces
